#### Tutorials and Tools for PyQt and PySide

***

MadQt is a pip package created to ease the process of using the Qt framework for python.

Qt is a powerful framework for designing Graphical User Interfaces written in c++ but
has a couple of wrappers (PyQt and PySide) that allow us to use the Python coding language.

MadQt aim is to automate and simplify many of the processes required by Qt as well
as provide custom widgets and QtDesigner plugins from and to the community.

### Compatibility
MadQt is compatible with python 3.9+ 

Due to PySide6 6.5.0 having some class inheritance issues,we have to limit the PySide6 version to 6.4.3


##### If you already have PySide6 6.5.0 installed, you can downgrade it by running the following command:
```bash
pip install PySide6==6.4.3
```

##### Otherwise, simple install MadQt and it will install the correct version of PySide6 for you.
